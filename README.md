Option
======

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/JosephMoniz/dart-option/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/JosephMoniz/dart-option/latest)

The option typeclass inspired by scala's implementation and Haskell's Maybe
monad. Option is a composable and more expressive alternative to things that
may be null on absence of value.
